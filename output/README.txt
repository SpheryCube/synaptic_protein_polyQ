Folders in this directory represent outputs for different hidden markov models.

Trained - Results using HMM trained on hand selected polyQ synaptic proteins.
Adjusted - Results using manually adjusted version of the trained HMM (increased the emission frequency of the targetAA to decrease false positive rate)

Currently using the mh-l for neuronal transcriptome filtering.
